## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Project Form Edit Silent Failure** - Fixed project edit form failing silently by replacing `useUpdateProject` mutation hook with direct Supabase calls (following NotedForm pattern). The mutation hook was swallowing errors and preventing form submission. Direct Supabase calls provide better error handling and debugging.
  - Issue: Edit form opened but couldn't save changes - failed silently
  - Root Cause: `useUpdateProject` mutation hook in `useProjects.ts` was failing silently
  - Solution: Use direct Supabase calls like `NotedForm.tsx` (which works)
  - Files: `src/components/forms/ProjectForm.tsx`
  - **Learning**: Always use direct Supabase calls for forms, avoid mutation hooks for form submissions
- **Sidebar Navigation Icons** - Fixed duplicate FileText icons between Projects and Forms navigation items
- **Icon Consistency** - Updated Projects sidebar to use FolderOpen icon matching dashboard card for visual coherence

### Changed

- **Sidebar Layout** - Moved Settings to footer section with visual separator for better navigation hierarchy
- **Navigation Organization** - Established pattern: main navigation in content area, secondary/settings items in footer

### Technical

- **Icon Management** - Resolved icon.svg conflicts by removing public/icon.svg, keeping app/icon.svg route
- **UI Patterns** - Implemented SidebarFooter + SidebarSeparator pattern for reusable secondary navigation sections
- **Navigation Structure** - Enhanced sidebar architecture with proper separation of primary and secondary navigation items
