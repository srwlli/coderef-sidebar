# Project Context for Claude Code

## Project Type

**Single-Developer Personal Tool**

This is a personal productivity dashboard developed and used exclusively by the developer. It is not a commercial product, client project, or multi-user application.

## Development Approach

### What to Prioritize

- **Technical excellence** - Focus on clean architecture, performance, and maintainability
- **Developer experience** - Optimize for the solo developer's workflow and preferences
- **Feature completeness** - Build features fully rather than compromising for business timelines
- **Code quality** - Prefer well-structured, documented code over quick hacks

### What NOT to Consider

- ❌ **Multiple users** - Single user (the developer) only
- ❌ **Business constraints** - No clients, deadlines, or stakeholders
- ❌ **Time estimates for business** - Time tracking is for planning only, not commitments
- ❌ **User onboarding/training** - Developer knows the codebase
- ❌ **User-facing documentation** - Only technical docs needed
- ❌ **Market considerations** - Not a product, no competitors, no monetization
- ❌ **Scale concerns** - Optimize for single-user performance, not thousands of users

## Planning Guidelines

When creating implementation plans:

- Focus on **technical approach** and **architecture decisions**
- Include time estimates for **personal planning** only (not commitments)
- Skip user research, user testing, user documentation
- Skip business justifications, ROI analysis, market positioning
- Assume developer has full context of existing codebase
- Prioritize code quality and maintainability over speed-to-market

## Feature Development Philosophy

**Personal Tool = Freedom to Experiment**

- Try new patterns without approval processes
- Refactor freely without business justification
- Build features the developer wants, not what "users" need
- Optimize for developer happiness and productivity

## Communication Style

When working with Claude Code:

- Be direct and technical
- Skip introductions and preambles
- Assume high technical literacy
- Focus on implementation details
- Question design decisions when appropriate
- Suggest better approaches proactively

## Technology Stack Philosophy

This project uses:

- **Next.js 15** - Latest features, app router
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety
- **Zustand** - Simple state management
- **Tailwind + shadcn/ui** - Modern styling
- **Supabase** - Auth and future database needs

The developer prefers:

- Functional components over class components
- Server components where appropriate
- Type-safe patterns throughout
- Minimal dependencies, leverage what's already installed
- Clean separation of concerns

## Current Project Phase

**Active Development** - Building out core features for personal dashboard customization.

The developer is comfortable with:

- Breaking changes (no other users affected)
- Experimental features (can roll back easily)
- Refactoring existing code (knows all usage patterns)
- Direct database access (single user, no data conflicts)
