PWA Icon Placeholder

For a complete PWA setup, you'll need to generate PNG icons in these sizes:
- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

Use the generated icon.svg as a base and convert to PNG at each size.

- Adobe Illustrator or Figma for professional icons

The current setup will work without icons, but you'll see broken image icons in the install prompt.
