Purpose: Execute enterprise-grade codebase analysis that provides comprehensive technical inventory, architectural assessment, quality evaluation, security analysis, and strategic improvement guidance for complex software systems spanning multiple technologies, teams, and business requirements. Enable informed decision-making for technical debt reduction, modernization planning, compliance verification, team scaling, and long-term technology strategy development.

Output: Generate exhaustive code-scan.md report delivering Executive Summary with strategic insights, Comprehensive Architecture Analysis including system topology and component interaction patterns, Complete Technology Stack Inventory featuring version compatibility matrix and lifecycle management considerations, Detailed File Structure Documentation with organizational patterns and dependency relationships, Quantitative Code Quality Assessment using industry-standard metrics and benchmarking data, Thorough Security Vulnerability Analysis with risk classifications and remediation priorities, Performance and Scalability Evaluation identifying optimization opportunities, Technical Debt Assessment with quantified improvement priorities, and Strategic Implementation Roadmap featuring phased approach with resource requirements and business value projections.

Work: Implement systematic codebase scanning methodology covering all source code files, configuration documents, infrastructure definitions, documentation assets, dependency declarations, and deployment specifications. Analyze programming language usage patterns, framework implementations, architectural design decisions, coding standard compliance, security practice adherence, performance optimization techniques, testing coverage adequacy, documentation completeness, and maintenance complexity factors using established software engineering evaluation frameworks and industry best practices.

Examples:

- System Architecture: "Event-driven microservices architecture comprising 24 services with message queuing via RabbitMQ, API Gateway using Kong, service mesh implementation with Istio, containerized deployment on Kubernetes cluster with Helm charts, monitoring via Prometheus and Grafana stack"
- Code Quality Metrics: "Overall technical debt ratio: 15.2% (industry average: 20%), maintainability index: 78/100, code coverage: 72% unit tests + 45% integration tests, cyclomatic complexity distribution: 68% low, 28% moderate, 4% high complexity functions"
- Security Assessment: "Vulnerability scan identified 12 findings: 2 CRITICAL (SQL injection in payment processing, exposed API keys in production config), 5 HIGH (XSS vulnerabilities in user input validation), 5 MEDIUM (outdated dependencies with known CVEs), remediation timeline: 2-6 weeks depending on severity"
- Strategic Recommendation: "Implement comprehensive DevSecOps pipeline including SAST/DAST integration, dependency vulnerability scanning, automated code quality gates, infrastructure as code security validation. Estimated implementation: 8-12 weeks, expected outcomes: 75% reduction in security findings, 40% improvement in deployment confidence, ROI positive within 6 months"

Requirements: Deliver quantitative analysis with statistical significance, provide specific file paths and line numbers for all findings, categorize recommendations by business impact and implementation complexity, include effort estimation and resource requirements for improvements, ensure executive summary suitable for non-technical stakeholders, maintain consistent professional markdown formatting with comprehensive navigation structure, integrate industry benchmarking data for context, and provide measurable success criteria for recommended improvements.
