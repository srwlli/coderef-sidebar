### Changed

- **Dashboard List View Layout** - Updated list view to use compact horizontal card layout
  - List view displays horizontal cards (icon beside title) in single column
  - Matches reference card sizing: 16px padding, 12px gap, 20px icons
  - Auto-height cards for more efficient space usage vs fixed-height grid cards
  - Clear visual distinction between list and grid view modes

- **Mobile Card Layout** - Optimized Dashboard cards for mobile viewing
  - Changed from 1-column to 2-column grid on mobile
  - Reduced card height: 128px → 96px for more compact display
  - Smaller icons on mobile: 24px (scales to 32px on larger screens)
  - Tighter spacing: 12px gap for better mobile density

- **Header Appearance** - Removed transparency for solid, opaque header background

- **Header Layout Consistency** - Moved stats/badges from right side to title area for uniform visual hierarchy across all pages
- **Navigation UX Enhancement** - Reserved top-right header space exclusively for action buttons and future functionality
- **Projects Header Enhancement** - Added project count badge and FolderOpen icon to match other page patterns
- **Projects Navigation Pattern** - Replaced modal sheets with in-place view switching for better context retention
- **Forms Page Simplified** - Removed project form, cleaned up to focus on future form builder features
- **Workflow Tools Update** - Relocated the Next.js Setup walkthrough to `/workflows/nextjs-setup` and removed it from the Tech Stacks list
- **Data Sync Pattern** - Migrated from complex React Query + realtime to simple useState + manual refresh for predictable updates
- **Code Architecture** - Reduced projects page from ~200 lines to 16 lines through component consolidation

### Fixed

- **Long-Press Text Selection** - Fixed unwanted text selection and context menu during long-press gestures
  - Added `e.preventDefault()` in `onPointerDown` to block selection initiation
  - Added `onContextMenu` handler to prevent right-click/long-press context menu
  - Applied CSS `userSelect: 'none'` and webkit variants via style prop
  - Eliminates "copy/paste/select all" popup during card long-press
  - Files: `src/hooks/use-long-press.ts`

- **Long-Press Style Property** - Fixed cards not rendering due to style prop spreading
  - Destructured `style` from `useLongPress` return value separately from event handlers
  - Applied style explicitly before spreading handlers to prevent prop conflicts
  - Fixed dashboard grid cards and ListCard component
  - Files: `src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`, `src/components/cards/ListCard.tsx`

- **Dashboard Hydration Error** - Fixed React Error #185 infinite render loop
  - Moved `GridCardItem` component definition outside `.map()` function
  - Prevented component recreation on every render that caused hydration mismatch
  - Changed keys from `index` to `item.href` for stable component identity
  - Created proper `DashboardItem` TypeScript type
  - Files: `src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`

- **Dashboard View Toggle** - Fixed view switching not updating immediately when toggling between grid and list
  - Implemented event-based state synchronization in useViewPreference hook
  - ViewToggle component now dispatches custom events that Dashboard listens for
  - View changes are instant without requiring page navigation or refresh
  - Resolved issue where separate hook instances had independent state

- **Page Layout Consistency** - Fixed inconsistent spacing and padding across all pages
  - Added responsive top padding: `pt-16` (64px mobile) / `sm:pt-12` (48px desktop)
  - Mobile maintains optimal spacing for header clearance
  - Desktop reduces spacing to match header height exactly, eliminating excessive gap
  - Removed redundant wrapper padding from Git Commands, Next.js Setup, and Prompts pages
  - Removed conflicting `overflow-y-auto` from Prompts page (layout handles scrolling)
  - All pages now use consistent horizontal padding: `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`
  - Eliminated double padding issues that caused uneven left/right margins

- **PWA Safe Area Handling** - Fixed header and sidebar alignment issues on iOS devices
  - Header positioned below safe area (`top-[env(safe-area-inset-top)]`) to prevent status bar overlap
  - Desktop sidebar adjusted with safe area calculations for proper height and positioning
  - Mobile sidebar sheet includes top padding for notch/status bar clearance
  - App layout uses dynamic viewport units (dvh) and bottom safe area insets

- **Project Form Edit Silent Failure** - Fixed project edit form failing silently by replacing `useUpdateProject` mutation hook with direct Supabase calls. The mutation hook was swallowing errors and preventing form submission. Direct Supabase calls provide better error handling and debugging.
  - Issue: Edit form opened but couldn't save changes - failed silently
  - Root Cause: `useUpdateProject` mutation hook in `useProjects.ts` was failing silently
  - Solution: Use direct Supabase calls modeled after other working form implementations
  - Files: `src/components/forms/ProjectForm.tsx`
  - **Learning**: Always use direct Supabase calls for forms, avoid mutation hooks for form submissions
- **Sidebar Navigation Icons** - Fixed duplicate FileText icons between Projects and Forms navigation items
- **Icon Consistency** - Updated Projects sidebar to use FolderOpen icon matching dashboard card for visual coherence

### Technical

- **Badge Integration** - Added Badge component imports and contextual count displays across all major pages
- **Future-Ready Extensibility** - Header structure designed to accommodate additional tools and actions without layout disruption
- **UI Pattern Consistency** - Projects now follow the unified UX pattern for maintainability
- **Component Architecture** - Created reusable view components following single responsibility principle
- **State Management** - Simplified data flow with useProjectsSimple hook modeled after stable production patterns
- **Database Integration** - Removed manual username field assignment, now expects Supabase auto-generation
- **Icon Management** - Resolved icon.svg conflicts by removing public/icon.svg, keeping app/icon.svg route
- **UI Patterns** - Implemented SidebarFooter + SidebarSeparator pattern for reusable secondary navigation sections
- **Navigation Structure** - Enhanced sidebar architecture with proper separation of primary and secondary navigation items
