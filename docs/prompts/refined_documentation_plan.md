## Chain Execution Plan: 3 Sets of 3 Chains (10 Total)

### Set 1: Foundation (Chains 1-3)

#### Chain 1: Initialize Structure

```xml
<purpose>Create root/coderef/ directory and initialize all 6 files with format standards</purpose>
<o>
- Create directory structure

- Establish consistent format standards
- Set up quality assessment frameworks
</o>
<work>CREATE ONLY - establish structure, no content analysis yet</work>
<requirements>All files in root/coderef/ with proper markdown structure, TOCs, placeholder sections</requirements>
```

#### Chain 2: Discovery Scan

```xml
<purpose>Populate all files with initial discovery findings</purpose>
<o>
- Basic project identification in architecture.md
- Initial component inventory in components.md and index.md
- Endpoint discovery in api.md
- Configuration basics in setup.md
- Initial quality framework in code-scan.md
</o>
<work>Read all initialized files, then SCAN codebase and UPDATE all files with basic findings</work>
<requirements>UPDATE all 6 files with initial discovery data, maintain format standards</requirements>
```

#### Chain 3: Component & API Mapping

```xml
<purpose>Complete component and API documentation across all relevant files</purpose>
<o>
- Detailed component analysis in components.md
- Complete API documentation in api.md
- Update index.md with full inventories
- Cross-reference components in architecture.md
- Add component/API quality metrics to code-scan.md
</o>
<work>Read all files, then ANALYZE components and APIs, UPDATE all relevant files</work>
<requirements>UPDATE all files with comprehensive component/API analysis, ensure cross-referencing</requirements>
```

### Set 2: Architecture & Integration (Chains 4-6)

#### Chain 4: Architecture Analysis

```xml
<purpose>Complete system architecture documentation</purpose>
<work>Read all files, then ANALYZE system design and UPDATE architecture.md, index.md, code-scan.md</work>
<requirements>Complete architecture documentation with design patterns, data flow, quality assessment</requirements>
```

#### Chain 5: Data Flow & Integration

```xml
<purpose>Document data flow patterns and external integrations</purpose>
<work>Read all files, then ANALYZE integrations and UPDATE architecture.md, api.md, setup.md, code-scan.md</work>
<requirements>Complete integration documentation across relevant files</requirements>
```

#### Chain 6: Setup & Configuration

```xml
<purpose>Complete setup and configuration documentation</purpose>
<work>Read all files, then ANALYZE setup requirements and FINALIZE setup.md, UPDATE index.md</work>
<requirements>Complete setup documentation with environment, build, and deployment guidance</requirements>
```

### Set 3: Quality & Synthesis (Chains 7-10)

#### Chain 7: Quality Assessment

```xml
<purpose>Complete quality analysis across all domains</purpose>
<work>Read all files, then ASSESS quality metrics and UPDATE quality sections in all files</work>
<requirements>Complete quality assessment with metrics, issues, and priority rankings</requirements>
```

#### Chain 8: Cross-Reference Integration

```xml
<purpose>Ensure all cross-references and consistency across files</purpose>
<work>Read all files, then VERIFY cross-references and UPDATE for consistency</work>
<requirements>Consistent cross-referencing, no conflicting information across files</requirements>
```

#### Chain 9: Final Synthesis

```xml
<purpose>Complete code-scan.md with comprehensive analysis</purpose>
<work>Read all files, then SYNTHESIZE findings into comprehensive code-scan.md</work>
<requirements>Executive summary, unified metrics, priority roadmap, implementation recommendations</requirements>
```

#### Chain 10: Executive Finalization

```xml
<purpose>Finalize all files with executive summaries and final formatting</purpose>
<work>Read all files, then FINALIZE executive summaries and ensure format compliance</work>
<requirements>All files complete with executive summaries, proper formatting, actionable recommendations</requirements>
```

## Analysis: 3 Sets of 3 Structure

### Benefits:

- **Logical Grouping**: Foundation → Architecture → Quality creates natural progression
- **Manageable Chunks**: 3-chain sets are easier to execute and debug
- **Parallel Processing**: Sets could potentially run in parallel after foundation
- **Clear Checkpoints**: Each set has defined completion criteria

### Concerns:

- **Context Complexity**: Managing 6 files simultaneously across chains increases complexity
- **Cross-File Dependencies**: Changes in one file may require updates in multiple others
- **Quality Control**: Ensuring consistency across 6 files with 10 update cycles is challenging

### Recommendation:

The 3-sets-of-3 structure works if each chain explicitly lists which files to update and maintains strict context awareness. However, consider whether managing 6 files simultaneously might introduce more complexity than the 2-file approach you originally preferred.

Alternative: Reduce to 4 files (merge index into architecture, merge setup into components) and use 3 sets of 3 chains for cleaner execution.
