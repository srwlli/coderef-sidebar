## XML Prompt Architecture

### Required Structure

All research-optimized prompts must use this XML framework:

```xml
<framework_element>Content following research principles</framework_element>
```

### Framework-Specific Elements

#### COSTAR Framework

```xml
<context>Background and domain information</context>
<objective>Specific task with output format - include scan/analysis restrictions</objective>
<style>Technical approach and methodology</style>
<tone>Communication register and attitude</tone>
<audience>Target users and their expertise level</audience>
<response>Structure, format requirements, specific deliverables</response>
```

#### POWER Framework

```xml
<purpose>Clear objective statement</purpose>
<o>Structured bullet-point output requirements</o>
<work>Context and constraints - include execution restrictions</work>
<examples>2-3 concrete examples showing desired patterns</examples>
<requirements>Quality standards and format specifications</requirements>
```

#### Five S Framework

```xml
<scene>Context setting for the task environment</scene>
<task>Specific action with clear scope and restrictions</task>
<simplify>Language guidance and accessibility requirements</simplify>
<structure>Output organization and formatting specifications</structure>
<feedback>Improvement mechanisms and iteration guidance</feedback>
```

#### CRISPE Framework

```xml

</response>
```

## Word Count Optimization

### Target Lengths by Use Case

**Simple Tasks (50-100 words)**

- Basic analysis or documentation
- Clear, well-defined objectives
- Minimal context required
- Cost-sensitive applications

**Complex Tasks (100-150 words)**

- Multi-step processes
- Technical analysis requiring context
- Professional deliverables
- Balance of quality and efficiency

**Avoid Exceeding 150 Words**

- Research shows diminishing returns beyond this point
- Increased cost without proportional quality improvement
- Higher risk of attention dilution and recency bias

### Length Optimization Techniques

**Content Reduction Strategies:**

- Remove redundant adjectives ("comprehensive," "detailed," "thorough")
- Eliminate corporate jargon and filler phrases
- Combine similar instructions into single statements
- Use specific terms instead of general descriptions

**Efficiency Patterns:**

- One instruction per XML element
- Concrete examples over abstract explanations
- Active voice over passive constructions
- Direct commands over polite requests

## Task-Specific Templates

### Code Analysis Template

```xml
<context>You analyze codebases systematically using 4-phase approach: Discovery → Architecture → Data Flow → Deep Analysis</context>
<objective>Generate [output-file].md with [specific deliverables] - SCAN ONLY, change no code</objective>
<style>Technical documentation following progressive analysis methodology</style>
<tone>Professional assessment focusing on actionable insights</tone>
<audience>Development teams needing systematic understanding</audience>
<response>
Phase 1: [specific requirements]
Phase 2: [specific requirements]
Phase 3: [specific requirements]
Phase 4: [specific requirements]
Format: [specific format with concrete deliverables]
</response>
```

### Working Plan Template

```xml
<purpose>Create systematic working plan for specified task with phased approach</purpose>
<o>
- Executive Summary with objectives
- Phase Breakdown with progression
- Implementation Steps with owners and timelines
- Resource Requirements and assignments
- Risk Assessment with mitigation
- Success Metrics with measurement criteria
</o>
<work>PLAN ONLY - analyze complexity, break into phases, define steps. Execute nothing.</work>
<examples>[2-3 concrete examples of phases, steps, or metrics]</examples>
<requirements>Save as working-plan-<task>.md, include specific owners, measurable outcomes</requirements>
```

## Critical Restrictions and Guidelines

### Mandatory Restrictions

Every prompt must include explicit restrictions to prevent unintended actions:

**For Analysis Tasks:** "SCAN ONLY, change no code"
**For Planning Tasks:** "PLAN ONLY, execute nothing"  
**For Documentation:** "DOCUMENT ONLY, no implementation"

### Forbidden Elements

Based on research findings, avoid these prompt elements:

**Redundant Language:**

- "Comprehensive analysis"
- "Detailed documentation"
- "Thorough assessment"
- "Strategic insights"

**Negative Instructions:**

- "Don't make changes"
- "Avoid modifying"
- "Don't implement"

**Vague Requirements:**

- "High-quality output"
- "Professional results"
- "Best practices"

### Required Specificity

Every prompt must include:

**Concrete Deliverables:** Specific file names, section headers, required elements
**Measurable Outcomes:** Quantitative criteria where applicable
**Clear Scope:** Explicit boundaries of what should and shouldn't be included
**Format Requirements:** Exact markdown structure, table formats, diagram types

## Quality Assurance Framework

## Implementation Best Practices

### Development Process

1. **Start with framework selection** based on task complexity and team needs
2. **Draft core elements** focusing on objective and deliverables first
3. **Add context minimally** - only what's essential for task completion
4. **Include 2-3 concrete examples** showing desired output patterns
5. **Specify exact format** with section headers and required elements
6. **Add explicit restrictions** to prevent unintended actions
7. **Test and optimize** based on actual performance metrics

### Testing Protocol

- **A/B test** prompt variations with single variable changes
- **Measure token efficiency** against quality outcomes
- **Document performance patterns** for future optimization
- **Iterate based on user feedback** and objective metrics

### Maintenance Guidelines

- **Regular review cycles** for prompt effectiveness
- **Update examples** based on successful outputs
- **Refine based on usage patterns** and performance data
- **Version control** for prompt iterations and improvements

## Framework Selection Guide

### Decision Matrix

| Task Complexity | Team Size  | Time Pressure | Recommended Framework |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| Simple          | Individual | High          | POWER                 |
| Simple          | Small team | Medium        | Five S                |
| Complex         | Large team | Low           | COSTAR                |
| Exploratory     | Any        | Low           | CRISPE                |

### Optimization Priorities by Framework

**POWER Framework:**

- Emphasize concrete examples and metrics
- Focus on clear output structure
- Minimize context to essential elements only

**COSTAR Framework:**

- Define audience characteristics precisely
- Align style and tone consistently
- Specify response format in detail

**Five S Framework:**

- Prioritize accessibility in language

- Balance structure with flexibility
- Enable experimentation within constraints

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### Token Efficiency Maximization

- **Use abbreviations** in XML elements where clear: `<o>` instead of `<output>`
- **Consolidate similar requirements** into single statements
- **Remove transitional phrases** between XML elements
- **Use bullet points** instead of full sentences where appropriate

### Context Engineering

- **Layer context progressively** from general to specific
- **Include only decision-relevant information**
- **Reference previous successful patterns** when applicable
- **Avoid assumption-heavy background information**

### Output Optimization

- **Specify exact section headers** required in deliverables
- **Define table structures** and required columns
- **Include diagram requirements** with specific content needs
- **Set measurable quality thresholds** where applicable

This research-optimized approach enables teams to create high-performance prompts that deliver superior results while minimizing costs and complexity. The XML structure combined with framework-specific optimization ensures consistent, measurable improvements in AI system interactions.
