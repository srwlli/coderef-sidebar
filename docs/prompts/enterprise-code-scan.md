# Research-Optimized Prompt Engineering Project Instructions

## Project Overview

**Purpose**: Create systematic, research-backed prompt engineering methodology using XML structure and prompt chaining for comprehensive AI agent context development.

**Research Foundation**: Based on analysis of 1,500+ academic papers, enterprise data from 1,712 users, and performance studies demonstrating 15% performance boost with XML formatting and up to 76% cost reduction through optimized prompt length.

## Core Methodology

### XML Prompt Structure (Mandatory)

All prompts must use XML formatting for 15% performance improvement:

```xml
<framework_element>Content following research principles</framework_element>
```

### Optimal Length Guidelines

- **Short Prompts (50-150 words)**: Primary target for most applications
- **Performance degrades at 3,000+ tokens** - well before technical limits
- **Structure matters more than length** - organized 50-word prompts often outperform 500-word alternatives

### Framework Rankings (By Performance)

1. **POWER Framework** - Highest performance, fastest setup
2. **COSTAR Framework** - Most comprehensive, enterprise-standard
3. **Five S Framework** - Best for teams, iterative improvement
4. **CRISPE Framework** - Most flexible, creative exploration

## Prompt Chain Architecture

### 4-Phase Progressive Methodology

Each complex analysis uses systematic chaining:

1. **Discovery Phase**: Scan and identify fundamentals
2. **Analysis Phase**: Build understanding and relationships
3. **Synthesis Phase**: Combine findings into structured documentation
4. **Final Phase**: Generate comprehensive report with strict output requirements

### Chain Execution Rules

- Each step builds on previous outputs
- Explicit file references between chains
- Mandatory restrictions: "SCAN ONLY", "PLAN ONLY", "NO CODE CHANGES"
- Progressive complexity: simple → detailed → comprehensive

## Application Areas

### 1. Codebase Documentation (48 chains)

**Directory**: `root/coderef/code-scan/`

**4 Phases × 4 Targets × 3 Steps = 48 total chains**

#### Phase 1: Project Foundation (Cold Entry)

- Project Type Classification → `project-type.md`
- Technology Stack Mapping → `tech-stack.md`
- Directory Structure Analysis → `directory-structure.md`
- Configuration Discovery → `configuration.md`

#### Phase 2: Code Architecture Mapping

- Component Identification → `components.md`
- Dependency Analysis → `dependencies.md`
- Design Pattern Recognition → `design-patterns.md`
- Code Organization Patterns → `organization.md`

#### Phase 3: Data Flow & Integration Analysis

- API Endpoint Mapping → `api-endpoints.md`
- Database Integration Analysis → `database-integration.md`
- External Service Integrations → `external-services.md`
- Data Flow Documentation → `data-flow.md`

#### Phase 4: Code Quality & Standards Assessment

- Code Standards Compliance → `code-standards.md`
- Documentation Coverage → `documentation-coverage.md`
- Function/Class Documentation → `function-docs.md`
- Module Interface Documentation → `module-interfaces.md`

### 2. Technology Research (4 chains)

**Directory**: `root/coderef/tech-research/`

1. **Release Discovery** → `release-discovery.md`
2. **Feature & Security Analysis** → `feature-security-analysis.md`
3. **Industry Adoption Analysis** → `adoption-strategy.md`
4. **Final Assessment Report** → `tech-assessment-report.md`

### 3. Working Plans (3 chains)

**Directory**: `root/coderef/working-plans/`

1. **Discovery & Planning** → `discovery-plan.md`
2. **Implementation Strategy** → `implementation-strategy.md`
3. **Final Working Plan** → `working-plan-<task>.md`

## Mandatory Output Requirements

### Standard Format Elements (All Chains)

- **Table of Contents** with numbered sections and clickable links
- **Executive Summary** with key metrics and bullet points
- **Findings in structured lists** (numbered/bulleted organization)
- **Metrics tables** with quantitative data where applicable
- **Consistent markdown hierarchy** (# ## ### ####)
- **Clear section headers** with descriptive names

### Final Phase Additional Requirements (Strict)

Final synthesis steps must include:

- **Priority classifications**: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW tags
- **Decision recommendations**: ADOPT/AVOID/MONITOR with rationale
- **Effort estimates**: Specific hours/days/weeks
- **Risk assessment matrix**: Probability and impact ratings
- **Success criteria**: Measurable KPIs and monitoring recommendations
- **Implementation timelines**: Phased approach with milestones

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] XML structure valid and complete
- [ ] Word count within 50-150 range for individual prompts
- [ ] Explicit restrictions included (SCAN ONLY, etc.)
- [ ] Specific deliverables and file paths defined
- [ ] Framework elements properly utilized
- [ ] No redundant language or corporate jargon
- [ ] Concrete examples provided
- [ ] Output format clearly specified

### Performance Metrics

- **Response accuracy and relevance**: Target >90%
- **First-pass success rate**: Target >80%
- **Token efficiency ratio**: Response Quality Score ÷ Token Count
- **Chain completion rate**: Target >95% without manual intervention

## Forbidden Elements (Research-Backed)

### Language to Avoid

- Redundant adjectives: "comprehensive," "detailed," "thorough"
- Negative instructions: "Don't do X" (use positive commands)
- Vague requirements: "high-quality," "professional," "best practices"
- Corporate jargon and filler phrases

### Structural Anti-Patterns

- Wall-of-text formatting without clear sections
- Mixing instructions and examples without separation
- Unclear boundaries between prompt components
- Missing explicit output format specifications

## Implementation Guidelines

### Chain Development Process

1. **Framework Selection**: Choose based on task complexity and team needs
2. **Core Elements Definition**: Focus on objective and deliverables first
3. **Context Minimization**: Include only essential decision-relevant information
4. **Example Integration**: 2-3 concrete examples showing desired patterns
5. **Format Specification**: Exact file paths, section headers, required elements
6. **Restriction Addition**: Explicit scope limitations (SCAN ONLY, etc.)
7. **Testing and Optimization**: A/B test variations, measure performance

### File Organization Strategy
