# Working Plan Prompts - Score 10/10 Versions

## COSTAR Framework (88 words)

```xml
<context>You create systematic working plans for tasks requiring structured implementation with clear accountability</context>

<objective>Generate working-plan-<task>.md with phased breakdown, steps, timelines, and success metrics - PLAN ONLY, execute nothing</objective>

<style>Professional project management using clear documentation standards</style>

<tone>Authoritative yet practical, focusing on implementable actions</tone>

<audience>Project teams and managers needing execution guidance with progress tracking</audience>

<response>
Structure: Executive Summary | Phase Overview | Implementation Steps | Resource Requirements | Timeline | Risk Assessment | Success Metrics

Include: Specific owners, realistic timelines, measurable deliverables, priority rankings

Format: Clear markdown with numbered phases, task tables
</response>
```

## POWER Framework (82 words)

```xml
<purpose>Create systematic working plan for specified task with phased implementation approach</purpose>

<output>
- Executive Summary with key objectives
- Phase Breakdown with logical progression
- Step-by-step Instructions with owners and timelines
- Resource Requirements and team assignments
- Risk Assessment with mitigation strategies
- Success Metrics with measurement criteria
</output>

<work>PLAN ONLY - analyze task complexity, break into phases, define steps with clear instructions. Execute nothing.</work>

<examples>
Phase: "Discovery & Planning (Weeks 1-2)"
Step: "Stakeholder interviews (Owner: PM, Duration: 3 days)"
Metric: "95% stakeholder satisfaction"
</examples>

<requirements>Save as working-plan-<task>.md, include timelines, specific owners, measurable outcomes</requirements>
```

## Five S Framework (89 words)

```xml
<scene>Teams need structured plans to implement tasks systematically with clear steps and accountability for successful execution</scene>

<task>CREATE working-plan-<task>.md breaking specified task into phases with steps and timelines. Plan only - execute nothing.</task>

<simplify>Use clear terms: phases, steps, owners, deadlines. Focus on practical implementation, avoid planning jargon</simplify>

<structure>
Plan sections: Executive Summary | Phase Overview | Implementation Steps | Resource Needs | Timeline | Success Metrics
Format: Numbered phases, step tables, clear headings
</structure>

<feedback>Include progress checkpoints and plan adjustment mechanisms for continuous improvement</feedback>
```

## CRISPE Framework (79 words)

```xml
<role>Expert project planner specializing in systematic task breakdown and implementation planning</role>

<insight>Effective plans balance comprehensive structure with practical execution, enabling teams to implement complex tasks through clear phases</insight>

<statement>Generate working-plan-<task>.md with systematic phase breakdown, steps, resources, and success measurement - PLANNING ONLY, no execution</statement>

<personality>Thorough and systematic while maintaining practical focus on implementable solutions</personality>

<experiment>Adapt planning depth based on task complexity. Explore multiple implementation approaches while maintaining structured framework</experiment>
